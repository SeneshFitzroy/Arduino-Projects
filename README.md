# Arduino Projects

This repository contains various Arduino-based projects designed to help users learn microcontroller programming, sensor interfacing, and control systems. Each project is created with the goal of introducing new hardware and software concepts through simple, practical examples.

## Projects

### 1. **Arduino LED Blink**
   - **Description**: A simple project that blinks an LED on an Arduino board. This project demonstrates basic LED control and the use of `digitalWrite()` and `delay()` functions.
   - **Components**: Arduino Board (e.g., Uno), LED, Resistor.
   - **Key Concepts**: Digital Output, Timing.

### 2. **Arduino OLED Display: Hello World**
   - **Description**: Displays "Hello World" on an OLED screen using the SSD1306 driver. This project showcases how to interface with an I2C OLED display and output text.
   - **Components**: Arduino Board (e.g., Uno), OLED Display (SSD1306).
   - **Key Concepts**: OLED Display, I2C Communication, Text Display.

### 3. **Keypad Input Reader**
   - **Description**: This project reads input from a 4x4 keypad and displays the corresponding keypress on the serial monitor. It demonstrates how to interface a keypad with Arduino and handle multi-button input.
   - **Components**: Arduino Board (e.g., Uno), 4x4 Keypad.
   - **Key Concepts**: Keypad Interfacing, Serial Communication.
